1)  Difference between synchronized method & synchronized block

        The difference is in which lock is being acquired:

        synchronized method acquires a method on the whole object. This means no other thread can use any synchronized method in the whole object while the method is being run by one thread.
        synchronized blocks acquires a lock in the object between parentheses after the synchronized keyword. Meaning no other thread can acquire a lock on the locked object until the synchronized block exits.
        So if you want to lock the whole object, use a synchronized method. If you want to keep other parts of the object accessible to other threads, use synchronized block.

        If you choose the locked object carefully, synchronized blocks will lead to less contention, because the whole object/class is not blocked.
